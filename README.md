# Application Name: WeatherDashboard_Week6:AGM
# About the project: I was given a task to build a weather dashboard that retrieves data from another applications API that will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. When the user searches for a city, they are presented with the current and future conditions for that city and it is added to a search history. The user is presented with the name of the city, date, icon representation of the weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. The 5-day forecast displays the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Using local storage, the user can also click on a city in the search history to see that cities current and future weather.
# Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
# Third Party API: Open Weather API
